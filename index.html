<ul>
<li>Click here for <a href="/webmaps/cabrach-forestry/index.html">Map One</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Maps collected here are tests of webmapping functionality in QGIS. </p>
<p>To read them, download the folder leaving the directory structure intact, then open &#39;index.html&#39; in a web browser (an internet connection is not necessary for this). </p>
<p>The map will then open in a web browser. </p>
<p>The dialogue box in the top left corner provides a list of the layers included in the map. Checking the box beside each layer will turn it on or off (by default, all layers are active when the map is first opened). </p>
<p>Clicking on any point in the map will open an infobox giving selected information from the attribute table for each active layer covering that point. Some layers will provide a link to further detail on an external website (an internet connection is necessary to follow these links). </p>
<p>The icons in the top left corner provide a measurement tool and zoom controls (a mouse wheel can also be used to zoom in and out). </p>
<p>With the appropriate plugins, QGIS can provide even more webmapping functionality, including 3D maps.</p>
